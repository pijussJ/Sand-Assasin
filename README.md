# Sand-Assasin
```
This is an intense and engaging action game that merges the atmosphere of the Dune books and films with the tension of Assassin's Creed. Your goal is to survive in the harsh desert environment and reach a powerful oasis where a crucial water source is hidden.

You envision yourself as an unconventional fighter armed with mysterious skills, striving to stay alive and achieve your objective.

Traversing through endless stretches of desert sand and rocks, you must be observant and strategic, because an enemy can strike at any moment.
